I am a PhD student at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Hongwei Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=-o6u2gwAAAAJ&hl).
I'm now a visiting Ph.D student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) working with [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).
I feel fortunate to be mentored by [Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/).

My research interests lie in **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, including the **Security and Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
